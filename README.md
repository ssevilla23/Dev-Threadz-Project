# ðŸ‘• Dev-Threadz Online Store

The Dev-Threadz Online store is a fictional shopping website that sells web development-themed shirts.
For this project, I was tasked to add functional features to the website using JavaScript in
order to replicate those found on real online stores.

Some of the features I implemented include:

+ **Search Bar**: Users can search for a specific shirt, which will be displayed based on their query.
+ **Currency Converter**: Users can choose their preferred currency from three options: US Dollars, Pound Sterling, and Japanese Yen.
+ **Add to Cart**: Users can add items to their cart and have the total price displayed in the cart menu.

Check out the website [here](https://ssevilla23.github.io/Dev-Threadz-Project/)!
